            We offer a <span className="font-semibold">30-day free trial</span> for users who wish to explore our
            platform before committing to a paid membership. After the trial ends,
            users may choose to subscribe to any of our paid membership plans.

            <li>All paid subscriptions are valid for a <span className="font-semibold">minimum period of one year</span> from the date of payment.</li>

            <li>If a member chooses <span className="font-semibold">not to renew</span> the subscription at the end of the billing cycle, access to the platform and services will be terminated immediately after the expiry date.</li>
            <li>Users can simply avoid renewing their membership to opt out for the following term.</li>

            <li>There are <span className="font-semibold">no partial or pro-rata refunds</span> for unused time or services.</li>
            <li>As our platform is login-based with no physical setup or product delivery, <span className="font-semibold">no onboarding or setup fees apply</span>, and hence, no refund is applicable.</li>
